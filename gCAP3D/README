2. Content of the Package

The gCAP package contains following main codes:

  cap3D.c	Generalized 3D Cut-and-Paste (gCAP3D) full moment-tensor inversion code.

  cap3D.pl	A Perl script to simplify the use of gCAP3D and to plot waveform fits.

  depth.pl	A perl script to read in the outputs of gCAP3D for different
		source depths and estimate the best source depth.

  mtdcmp.f	A Fortran code to decompose a general moment tensor into ISO, DC
		and CLVD tensors, and to compute the ISO and CLVD parameters.

  radpttn.c	A C code to compute the normalized moment tensor components
		from strike dip rake iso clvd and the P/SV/SH radiation pattern.


3. Installation

To compile the codes see Makefile. It requires that 
SAC has been installed. Set environment variable
SAC_HOME to point to where it is installed accordingly.


4. Usage

For usage, run cap3D.pl without argument. To test using the provided
2008 Mt Carmel earthquake data, first calculate the Green's functions
of CUS model (included), then do
> make 20080418093700/mt.best

6. Revision History

    Nov 24, 2013	LZ	modified from cap.c to include using 3D Green's functions.
    Nov 23, 2014	LZ	revised to filter data/GFs before windowing.
    May 05, 2015	LZ	delete search for mw. use m0 = sqrt(u2/s2);
    Sept. 17, 2019	LZ	remove the dependence on Numerical Recipes.
